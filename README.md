Emotion recognition is the process of identifying human emotion. People vary widely in their accuracy at recognizing the emotions of others. Use of technology to help people with emotion recognition.

Deep Learning for Data Visualization and Model Training. This project explores data visualization and classification using deep learning techniques. We begin by importing the necessary libraries and datasets, followed by a detailed data exploration phase to uncover patterns. Using an AutoEncoder, we perform dimensionality reduction and visualize the data using T-SNE, helping to understand its inherent structure before diving into more advanced modeling.
